# XML Processing and JSON Conversion Project

## Overview

This project involves processing XML order files, converting them into JSON format, and implementing error handling to ensure robust processing.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**: Create a repository to store the code, logs, and outputs.
2. **Folder Structure**:
   - Create a folder named `/xml-files/` to store the downloaded XML files.
   - Create a `process.log` file for logging purposes.
3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed along with the `xmltodict` library. You can install it using:
     ```bash
     pip install xmltodict
     ```

## Approach

1. **Read XML Files**: The script iterates through each XML file in the `/xml-files/` directory.
2. **Extract Key Fields**: Key fields such as `OrderID`, `Customer`, and `Products` are extracted from the XML.
3. **Convert to JSON**: The extracted data is converted into JSON format using the `xmltodict` library.
4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: The script continues processing even if some files contain errors or missing elements.

## Error Handling

- The script implements comprehensive error handling to manage:
  - **Missing Elements**: If a required XML element is missing, a warning is logged.
  - **Malformed XML**: If the XML structure is incorrect, an error message is logged.
  - **Unexpected Fields**: Warnings are issued for unexpected fields present in the XML.

## Challenges Faced

- **Malformed XML**: Encountered issues with incorrectly formatted XML files, handled using specific error checks.
- **Missing Elements**: Developed a strategy to gracefully manage missing elements while continuing processing.
- **Logging**: Ensured that logs are informative and provide clear traceability of the processing steps.

## Tools and Resources

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **xmltodict**: A library used for parsing XML and converting it to JSON.
- **Logging**: Standard logging library in Python for capturing events and errors.

## Running the Script

1. Place the XML files in the `/xml-files/` directory.
2. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```
3. Check the `process.log` file for details on the processing outcomes.

## Logging

- All processing activities, including successes, warnings, and errors, are logged in the `process.log` file.
- The log entries include timestamps and descriptive messages to aid in debugging and traceability.
